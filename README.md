The Sales ERP Management System is a web-based enterprise application designed to manage and analyze product sales, salesperson performance, and organizational growth across multiple companies. The system provides a centralized platform for tracking sales activities, identifying top-performing salespersons, and visualizing key business metrics through interactive dashboards.

This project aims to replace traditional manual reporting and spreadsheet-based systems with an intelligent, scalable, and data-driven solution.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a multi-tenant web portal designed to manage product sales data for multiple companies. Each company can register on the portal, manage its products and salesmen, track sales performance, and visualize sales data. The system highlights top-performing salesmen, product-wise sales, and overall company performance using interactive dashboards.

The goal of this project is to help companies make data-driven decisions by clearly understanding who sold more products, which products perform best, and how sales trends change over time.
