# REPLACE [YOUR-PASSWORD] below with your actual Supabase password if not already done
# The user should have updated this. I will preserve the existing string if possible, 
# but since I am overwriting, I will use the one I know is there or the placeholder.
# Actually, I should check the current content first to not lose the password if they typed it.
# BUT, I'll assume they did or I'll just write the standard setup.
# Wait, I shouldn't overwrite database.py if it has the password. 
# I'll view it first? No, I viewed it in the last turn.
# It had postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]...
# I will assume the user has updated it or will update it. 
# I will NOT write database.py in this step to avoid overwriting their password.
# I will focus on auth/models.py

# This file is for auth/models.py
