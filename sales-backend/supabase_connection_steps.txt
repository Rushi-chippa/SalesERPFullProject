Steps to get the IPv4 Database Connection String (Based on your screenshot):

1. In the "Connect to your project" window shown in your screenshot:
   - Look at the dropdown menu labeled **"Method"** (currently says "Direct connection").
   - Click it.
   - Select **"Transaction Pooler"** (or "Session Pooler" if transaction isn't there, but Transaction is better for Python).
   - If "Transaction Pooler" isn't in the dropdown, click the **"Pooler settings"** button below the warning message.

2. Once you select the Pooler method, the **connection string** in the box below will change.
   - It should now look something like:
     `postgresql://postgres.yourproject:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`
   - Notice the port number is usually **6543**.
   - Notice the domain is `pooler.supabase.com`.

3. **Copy that entire new connection string.**

4. Open your local `.env` file:
   `C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\IVPROJECT\sales-backend\.env`

5. Replace the entire `DATABASE_URL` line with the new string you copied.

6. **IMPORTANT PASSWORD STEP:**
   - If your password is `EndHungerNow@24`, you MUST change the `@` to `%40` in the URL.
   - Example line in .env:
     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.abcdef:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`
     (Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with `EndHungerNow%4024`)

7. Save the `.env` file and run `python main.py`.
