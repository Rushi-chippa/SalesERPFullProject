Steps to Fix "FATAL: password authentication failed":

1. The connection is reaching Supabase now! (This is good news).
2. The error "password authentication failed" means the password in your .env file is wrong.

Option A: Check your .env file carefully
   - Open C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\IVPROJECT\sales-backend\.env
   - Look at the part after "postgres.yourproject:"
   - Specifically the password section.
   - If your password is "EndHungerNow@24", it MUST be written as "EndHungerNow%4024"
   - Make sure there are no extra colons or spaces.

Option B: Reset your Database Password (Easiest Fix)
   1. Go back to Supabase Dashboard.
   2. Click "Project Settings" (gear icon) -> "Database".
   3. Scroll to "Reset your database password" (usually at the bottom right).
   4. Click "Reset password".
   5. Create a NEW password that has NO special characters (only letters and numbers).
      - Example: "EndHungerNow2024" (remove the @ symbol).
   6. Update your local .env file with this new password.
      - Since it has no special characters, you don't need %40.
      - It will just be: ...:EndHungerNow2024@aws-0...

7. Run `python main.py` again.
