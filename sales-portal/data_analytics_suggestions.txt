# Data Analytics Implementation Suggestions for Sales Portal

Here are practical Data Analytics features you can implement using your existing data (Sales, Products, Salesmen, Customers). These range from descriptive analytics (what happened) to diagnostic analytics (why it happened).

## 1. Executive Dashboard Analytics
- **Real-time KPI Cards**:
  - **Revenue Run Rate**: Projected revenue for the month based on current daily average.
  - **Active Salesmen Ratio**: % of salesmen with at least one sale this week.
  - **Top Product Mover**: The product with the highest increase in sales velocity compared to last month.
- **Sales Funnel Visualization**:
  - Track conversion from *Lead* -> *Opportunity* -> *Close* (Requires adding a 'Leads' table).

## 2. Product Intelligence
- **ABC Analysis (Inventory Classification)**:
  - **Class A**: High-value products (top 80% revenue).
  - **Class B**: Moderate value (next 15%).
  - **Class C**: Low value (bottom 5%).
  - *Action*: Prioritize stocking Class A products.
- **Product Affinity (Market Basket Analysis)**:
  - "Customers who bought Product X also bought Product Y".
  - *Action*: Create bundles or suggestions for salesmen to cross-sell.
- **Slow-Moving Inventory Alert**:
  - Identify products with zero sales in the last 30/60/90 days.
  - *Action*: Create discount campaigns to clear stock.

## 3. Customer Insights (CRM Analytics)
- **RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)**:
  - Segment customers into groups:
    - **Champions**: Bought recently, buy often, and spend the most.
    - **Loyal Customers**: Buy on a regular basis.
    - **At Risk**: Spending big but haven't bought recently.
  - *Action*: Tailor marketing/sales calls based on segment.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**:
  - Estimate the total revenue a customer will generate over their relationship.
  - *Action*: Focus retention efforts on high CLV customers.
- **Churn Risk Indicators**:
  - Flag customers whose purchase frequency has dropped significantly (e.g., used to buy weekly, now hasn't bought in 3 weeks).

## 4. Sales Force Effectiveness
- **Consistency Score**:
  - Instead of just total sales, measure the *standard deviation* of a salesman's daily sales.
  - *Insight*: High consistency is often better than sporadic big wins.
- **Activity vs. Outcome**:
  - (Requires 'Activity' tracking): Correlate number of client visits/calls to actual sales revenue.
- **Win Rate Analysis**:
  - (Requires 'Leads' tracking): Percentage of leads converted to sales per salesman.

## 5. Regional & Temporal Trends
- **Geographic Heatmap**:
  - Visual map showing sales concentration by region/city.
  - *Action*: Identify under-served territories.
- **Seasonality Detection**:
  - Analyze monthly sales over 2-3 years to identify repetitive patterns (e.g., sales spike in November).
  - *Action*: Stock up before peak seasons.
- **Day-of-Week / Time-of-Day Analysis**:
  - When do most sales happen? (e.g., "Tuesday mornings are peak").
  - *Action*: Optimize salesmen schedules.

## 6. Implementation Strategy (Tech Stack)
- **Backend (FASTAPI + Pandas)**:
  - Use Python's `pandas` library for heavy data manipulation (RFM, ABC analysis).
  - creating dedicated endpoints like `/api/analytics/rfm` or `/api/analytics/product-affinity`.
- **Frontend (React + Chart.js/Recharts)**:
  - Use **Scatter Plots** for Customer Segments.
  - Use **Heatmaps** for regional data.
  - Use **Sankey Diagrams** for product flow or funnels.
